**THIS IS STILL WIP and is missing some key features! I am working on the in conjunction with a game. More updates to come!**

# Libretto Scripting Language

The libretto scripting language is a strongly typed narrative scripting language designed for the Rust :crab: ecosystem. This language is in early stages of development, but here are some of its features: 

- Easy to read, almost film script esc format for writing dialog.
- For the logic components, a rust lite syntax with strong typing.
- A fast reliable, interpreter for development.
- Ability to compile any Libretto AST to a binary format for packaging with a game (thank you Serde)
- Easy to learn syntax.

## Motivation

The growing Rust Game Development community is in need of a narrative tool like this. With libretto's first class support, it is easy and low cost to create dialog systems for you games.

## Contributing

I would love to have contributors to this project, if you are interested in helping, leave an issue. If you do, I will get you resources to help. Until the language is more mature, I won't be able to make resources on the language, as the spec has (and will) make its fair share of changes.
